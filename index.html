        <h4 class="header4">Preliminary Research</h4>
        <p class="paragraph2">Before even starting our first case study, my project team and I came together to see what
            we’re
            passionate about. We all knew that we wanted to help people, <br> but we just didn’t know what area of focus
            we
            were to tackle. So, we decided to mind-dump everything onto sticky notes! </p>
        <img class="image2" src="Images/Sticky_Notes.png">
        <p class="paragraph3">When finding out that we all wanted to tackle a project based on health, we decided to
            focus on
            medication-tracking since we noticed a big majority of health-based <br>apps related to medication.
            Next, I took the responsibility of finding quantitative-based insights of how many medication users in the
            U.S. use phone apps to track <br>their habits. </p>
    </head>

    <head>
        <h5 class="header5">Important Findings</h5>
        <div class="d-flex flex-row">
            <div class="p-1">70% <br> of <br>U.S. Citizens <br> (All Ages) <br> take 1 <br>Prescription-based <br> Medication.<br> (NEIH) </div>
            <div class="p-2">50% <br> of <br> the 2 Billion <br> prescriptions filled <br> each year <br> are not <br> taken properly. <br> (Epill.com)   </div>

          </div>
        <p class="paragraph4">
            With the statistics provided above, we were set in wanting to create an app solely on improving 
            Medication-taking and tracking. Rather than trying to create an entirely <br> new app with new designs, 
            we as a team wanted to what improvements can be taken so that medication-users can have an easier time
            in taking their prescriptions.

        <h7 class="subheading1">Our Survey Findings</h7>
        <p class="paragraph5">
            Our purpose in creating our survey was to quantifiably measure how certain U.S. individuals from the age 
            range of 30+ take and track their medications. Our survey was divided into 2 portions: medication taking    
            habits and how people use their phones.

        </h11>
        <p class="paragraph6">
            From our survey findings, there was an estimate of 26.9%  of our survey takers who have reported take at
            least 1 medication. Additionally, 53.8% of our survey takers reported having their phone every day is a 
            priority.

        <p class="paragraph7">
            The type of people we had interviewed were in the age demographic of 40-60 and surprisingly, we found 
            that people don’t have any problems using their phones.<br> Rather than trying to implement new ways of 
            making medication-tracking, we decided to focus on what people like about their phones in hopes of
            implementing <br> our findings in our mobile app design.

            From our findings, we found that people were able to take their medications based on habits. Upon 
            iterating, our main goal for creating our app was to think of ways making medication-taking natural and
            easy.

            <p class="paragraph9">
                With wanting to create an app that can be used incorporated in anyone’s daily lives, we had to figure out
                exactly how leading apps succeeded. We as a team conducted a cross-comparative competitor analysis to
                to gather insights about what we liked and what can be improved.

          </ul>
        <p class="paragraph10">
            From the data we collected, we now had our goals to make medication-tracking much easier
            and simpler to use through the process of easy navigation and having everything <br> in one 
            place. Now it’s just the matter of creating our potential user: an every-day guy who wants to
            live a healthy life and do what he loves every single day.

            keeping both him, and the data we received on how people used their phones, we didn’t 
            want to assume that everyone has an easy means of navigating. So, our next task was to figure
            out: What are the steps users, like Alfred, would take in terms of fulfilling their goal?… But 
            first, let’s establish our tasks. </p>

            <li>To create a medication reminder for Lisinopril.</li>
            <li>To create a reminder to check Blood Pressure (BP).</li>
            <li>To confirm you've taken Lisinopril in 7 hours.</li>
        </ol>
    </head>

    <head>
            <p class="header19">Keeping our Tasks in Mind, it was now time to create our User Flow. </p>
            <img class="taskflow" src="Images/taskflow.png">
            <p class="pargraph13">
                As you can see from the “Choose Type of Reminder” action, our steps for creating certain 
                reminders are meticulous and in a series of “one-by-one”. Habits can’t be learned overnight
                nor can they fully be accepted overnight either. So, the best way to create a habit is to build.
                “As you build, break habits into chunks” (James Clear). <br>

                For our Blood Pressure reminder specifically, we wanted our users to be able to manually 
                put in their respective info (Systolic, Diastolic, and BPM) so they have control over the 
                information they have. Additionally, by inputting results every time, our goal was to make sure
                that our users also know what goes in to checking their Blood Pressure through constantly 
                doing it over and over again. <br>

                Finally, constructing our flows and our certain tasks for the current motivation, it’s now time
                to present our first current wireframes! <br>
            </p>

    <head>
        <h20 class="header20">Lo-Fi Wireframing Before (A/B/C Testing)</h20>
        <img class="wireframes" src="Images/Lofi.png">
        <p class="paragraph14">
            Presented here are the wireframes for creating a reminder for Lisinopril. 

            For my initial wireframes, I really wanted this step-by-step process to be done in a top down
            and linear style. I wanted the user to sequentially fill out all of the information before moving
            onto the very second page. I believe that our user shouldn’t forget about anything regarding 
            their health and they should have the feeling that their health can be prioritized. 

            But, with this being my very first case study, it’s important to showcase what struggles I came
            about and the things I think about now as opposed to when I was creating these wireframes. 
        </p>
        <img class="annotations" src="Images/annotations.png">
        <p class="paragraph15">
            Here are some quick iterations I did just now. I was not the same student I was 3 months
            ago but efforts in critically thinking about layout and structure are paramount for a great 
            experience. 

            As for my design wireframes, I really needed to improve my efforts in consistency:
            consistency through the buttons and through the spacing. Additionally, one thing I 
            overlooked was a back button! What if my User wanted to go back?? How could they?

            I knew at this point, I had strengths in research, but I needed more practice 
            in UX Designing. Throughout my portfolio, I will be showcasing how I did just that but
            this particular project, and thankfully with collaboration and feedback, really emphasized
            the importance of creating an effective design!
